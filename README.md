The purpose of the project was to try to replicate the results of the work done in this [PAPER](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07210-0), in which the authors focus on developing DNN representations of Koopman eigenfunctions that remain interpretable and parsimonious, even for high-dimensional and strongly nonlinear systems. All data and methodologies can be reconstructed using the code available at [GIT](https://github.com/BethanyL/DeepKoopman).
