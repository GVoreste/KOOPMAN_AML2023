    "In this work they tried to identify only a *few key* intrinsic coordinates $\\textbf{y} = \\varphi(\\textbf{x})$ spanned by a set of Koopman eigenfunctions $\\varphi: \\mathbb{R}^p \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^n$, in the context of a dynamical system $\\textbf{y}_{k+1}=\\textbf{Ky}_k$. In particular, intrinsic coordinates which are useful in order to recostruct the dynamics are those for which $\\textbf{y} = \\varphi(\\textbf{x})$, hence, the state x can be recovered with the inverse $\\textbf{x} = \\varphi^{-1}(\\textbf{y})$ so that the state x may be recovered. This is achieved using an auto-encoder (in the following picture), where the action of $\\varphi$ is implemented by the encoder and the action of $\\varphi^{-1}$ by the decoder. The dimension p of the auto-encoder subspace is a hyperparameter of the network that the authors of the paper have chosen guided by knowledge of the system and subsequently tuned. So we decided to follow their choices.\n",

    "Moreover, they generalized this framework to include a broad class of nonlinear systems that exhibit a continuous eigenvalue spectrum $\\lambda$. A continuous spectrum is characterized by a continuous range of observed frequencies, as opposed to the discrete spectrum consisting of isolated, fixed frequencies. This phenomena is observed in a wide range of physical systems that exhibit broadband frequency content, such as turbulence and nonlinear optics. The continuous spectrum spoils the simple Koopman descriptions, as there is not a straightforward finite approximation in terms of a small number of eigenfunctions. Indeed, away from the linear regime, an infinite Fourier sum is required to approximate the shift in frequency and eigenfunctions due to the non linearity.\n",
    "To deal with this problem, they allowed the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\textbf{K}$ to vary, parametrized by the function $\\lambda = \\Lambda(\\textbf{y})$, which is learned by an auxiliary network (in the following figure). The eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\pm} = \\mu \\pm i \\omega$ are then used to parametrize block-diagonal $\\textbf{K}(\\mu,\\omega)$.\n",
    "In particular, they built separate auxiliary networks, one for the complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues and one for the the real eigenvalue. In this way, we can avoid to perform an infinite asymptotic expansion of the eigenfunctions. So, the resulting networks remain parsimonious, and the few key eigenfunctions are interpretable.\n",
